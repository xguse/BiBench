=======================
Introduction to BiBench
=======================

BiBench is a Python library designed to simplify biclustering tasks. It
provides the following features:

    * Supports many biclustering algorithms, and it is easy to add more.
    * Download gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus.
    * Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.
    * Synthetic dataset generation.
    * Data transformation.
    * Results validation and visualization.

Typical usage often looks like this::

    > import bibench.all as bb         # import most commonly used functions
    > data = bb.get_gds_data('GDS181') # download gene expression dataset GDS181
    > data = bb.pca_impute(data)       # impute missing values
    > biclusters = bb.plaid(data)      # cluster with Plaid algorithm
    > bb.enrichment(biclusters[0])     # Gene Ontology enrichment analysis

============
Installation
============

Instructions for installing BiBench and its dependencies. BiBench is
written for Python 2. It has been tested with both Python 2.6 and 2.7.

----------------------
Installation Procedure
----------------------

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Automatic Installation with pip
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

`pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ and `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ are currently the best way
to install and manage Python packages. This method is also recommended
because pip should automatically install BiBench's
dependencies. (Note: One of BiBench's dependencies is rpy2, which
requires that `R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_ be installed. Also, R
must have been built as a library. i.e., configured with
``--enable-R-shlib``. If you want pip to install BiBench without
installing dependencies, use ``pip install --no-deps`` in the
following steps).

Install pip. If necessary, you can use pip to install virtualenv and
virtualenvwrapper::

    pip install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper

To create a new virtual environment called bibench_env and install
BiBench and its dependencies to it::

    mkvirtualenv --no-site-packages bibench_env
    pip install http://bmi.osu.edu/hpc/software/bibench/BiBench-0.1.tar.gz

Pip can also install from a local package::

    wget http://bmi.osu.edu/hpc/software/bibench/BiBench-0.1.tar.gz
    pip install BiBench-0.1.tar.gz

BiBench is now installed and ready to go.

The BiBench package is now installed into its own virtual environment,
``bibench_env``, which is an isolated Python environment. So before
using BiBench you must switch to that environment::

    workon bibench_env

When you are done working in that environment, simply run the
deactivate command::

    deactivate

    
+++++++++++++++++++
Manual installation
+++++++++++++++++++

BiBench is packaged using `distutils
<http://docs.python.org/library/distutils.html>`_.  To install BiBench
manually, simply download it, unpack it, and run the distutils setup
script::

    wget http://bmi.osu.edu/hpc/software/bibench/BiBench-0.1.tar.gz
    tar xzf BiBench-0.1.tar.gz
    cd BiBench-0.1
    python setup.py install


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Building the documentation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This documentation may be compiled into a number of formats, using
sphinx. To generate html::

    make html

For a list of all possible targets, run::

    make help

------------
Dependencies
------------

The BiBench package is now installed, but most of its functionality
will not be available until extra dependencies are available.

In particular, BiBench does not provide implementations for biclustering algorithms; they must be installed seperately.

+++++++++++++++++++
Python Dependencies
+++++++++++++++++++

* `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
* `rpy2 <http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html>`_
* `decorator <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator>`_
* `nose <code.google.com/p/python-nose/>`_ (optional: for running unit tests)
* `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ (optional: to make the documentation)

If you install BiBench using pip, you should not need to install these
packages manually; pip should automatically handle dependencies.

If you chose not to install BiBench's dependencies before, you can install them with pip::

    pip install numpy rpy2

To install optional dependencies simply run::

    pip install nose sphinx


++++++++++++++
R Dependencies
++++++++++++++

Some algorithms that BiBench supports are available as packages for R;
BiBench also relies on R for some visualization methods and other
functionality. To communicate with R, the Python package rpy2 must be
installed.

`R <http://www.r-project.org/>`_ must be compiled as a shared library
using ``--enable-R-shlib``. Assuming that R is installed, the
following commands in R should install all of BiBench's dependencies::

    install.packages(c('biclust', 'isa2', 'MASS'))
    source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
    biocLite(c('fabia',
               'GEOquery',
	       'GEOmetadb',
	       'GOstats',
	       'GO.db',
	       'multtest',
	       'pcaMethods'))

The the rest of this section provides links to those dependencies.

The following may be installed with the R command ``install.packages()``:

* `biclust <cran.r-project.org/package=biclust>`_
* `isa2 <http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/isa2/index.html>`_
* `MASS <http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html>`_

The rest of the packages require `Bioconductor
<http://www.bioconductor.org/>`_. Here are the `installation
directions <http://www.bioconductor.org/install/>`_ for Bioconductor
and its packages.

* `fabia <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fabia.html>`_

For downloading GDS data:

* `GEOquery <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.8/bioc/html/GEOquery.html>`_
* `GEOmetadb <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.2/bioc/html/GEOmetadb.html>`_

For gene ontology enrichment analysis:

* `GOstats <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GOstats.html>`_
* `GO.db <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/GO.db.html>`_
* `multtest <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/multtest.html>`_
* The correct `AnnotationData <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.6/data/annotation/>`_ package for your organism.

For missing data imputation:

* `pcaMethods <http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/1.9/bioc/html/pcaMethods.html>`_


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Other Algorithm Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

These algorithms are not available for R or Python. They must be
manually built and installed, and their binaries must be available on
the PATH, in order for the appropriate module in
``bibench.algorithms`` to work.

* `BBC <http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~junliu/BBC/>`_
* `COALESCE <http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/sleipnir/>`_ (as part of the Sleipnir software)
* `CPB <http://bmi.osu.edu/hpc/software/cpb>`_
* `OPSM <http://bmi.osu.edu/hpc/software/OPSM.tar.gz>`_ (modified for command-line use from `BicAT <http://www.tik.ethz.ch/sop/bicat/>`_)
* `QUBIC <http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~maqin/bicluster/>`_
